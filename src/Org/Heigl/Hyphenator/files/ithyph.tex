                           ON ITALIAN HYPHENATION

I have been working on patterns for the Italian language since 1987; in 1992
I published

C. Beccari, "Computer aided hyphenation for Italian and Modern
      Latin", TUG vol. 13, n. 1, pp. 23-33 (1992)

which contained a set of patterns that allowed hyphenation for both  Italian
and  Latin;  a  slightly  modified  version of the patterns published in the
above paper is contained in LAHYPH.TEX available on the CTAN archives.


This minor revision has been tested  with an enlarged set of difficult Italian
words so as to comply  with  a larger  number  of technical words with foreign
roots. The overall number of patterns is slightly reduced, but its strength is
increased. As with the previous  release hyathi are not hyphenated in order to
cope  with  the  habits  of Italian  readers.  Similarly single vowel internal
syllables are avoided.

As the previous versions, this new set  of  patterns does  not  contain  any
accented  character  so  that  the hyphenation algorithm behaves properly in
both cases, that is with OT1 and T1 encodings.   With  the  former  encoding
fonts  do  not contain  accented characters,  while with the latter accented
characters are present and sequences such as à map directly to slot "E0 that
contains "agrave".

Of course if you use T1 encoded  fonts you get the full power of the hyphen-
ation algorithm, while if you use OT1 encoded  fonts you  miss some possible  
break  points;  this  is  not a big inconvenience in Italian because:

1) The Regulation UNI 6015 on  accents  specifies  that  compulsory  accents
   appear  only  on the ending vowel of oxitone words; this means that it is
   almost indifferent to have or  to  miss  the T1 encoded fonts because the 
   only  difference  consists in how TeX  evaluates  the end of the word; in 
   practice if you have these special  facilities you get "qua-li-tà", while 
   if  you miss them, you get "qua-lità" (assuming that \righthyphenmin > 1).

2)  Optional  accents are so rare in Italian, that if you absolutely want to
   use  them  in  those  rare  instances,  and  you  miss  the  T1  encoding
   facilities, you should also provide  explicit discretionary hyphens as in
   "sé\-gui\-to".

There is no explicit  hyphenation  exception  list  because  these  patterns
proved  to  hyphenate correctly a very large set of words suitably chosen in
order to test them in the most heavy circumstances; these patterns were used
in the preparation of a number of books and no errors were discovered.

Nevertheless if you frequently use  technical terms that you want hyphenated
differently  from  what  is  normally  done  (for  example  if  you   prefer
etymological  hyphenation  of  prefixed  and/or  suffixed  words) you should
insert a specific hyphenation  list  in  the  preamble of your document, for
example:

\hyphenation{su-per-in-dut-to-re su-per-in-dut-to-ri}

If you use, as you should, the italan  option of the babel package, then you 
have available the active charater "  that allows you to put a discretionary 
break at a word boundary of a compound word while maintaning the hyphenation 
algorithm on the rest of the word. 

Please, read the babel package documentation.

Should you find any word that gets hyphenated in a wrong way, please, AFTER
CHECKING ON A RELIABLE MODERN DICTIONARY, report to the author, preferably
by e-mail.


                       Happy multilingual typesetting!
