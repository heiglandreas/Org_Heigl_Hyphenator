Installation
############

Installation using PEAR
=======================

Probably the easiest way of installing the ``Hyphenator``-package
is using the PEAR-Installer

Only the following two steps are needed:

::

    pear channel-discover pear.heigl.org
    pear install org.heigl/Hyphenator

Installation using packagist
============================

The ``Hyphenator``-package can also be installed via packagist. Simply include
the following in your ``composer.json``-File:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require" : {
            [...]
            "org_heigl/hyphenator": "2.0.*"
        }
    }

After that you can run packagist using

.. code-block:: bash

    php composer.phar install

Installation from a downloaded package
======================================

This installation is not much more complicated and probably the
best way for hosted installations

#. Take the :file:`Org`-Folder and place it somewhere your include-path reaches
   it.
#. Optionally you can copy the folder :file:`Org/Heigl/Hyphenator/shared`
   to any location you like and set the ``HYPHERNATOR_HOME``-Environment
   Variable or PHP-constant to that path before invoking the Hyphenator
   for the first time.
#. Register the autoloader by calling Org\Heigl\Hyphenator\Hyphenator::registerAutoload()
#. Hyphenate!

Installed Hyphenation-Patterns
==============================

This package includes hyphenation-patterns for the following locales.
These are taken from the svn-directory of the OpenOffice.org-CVS hosted at
apache.org. For more inforamtions have a look at `https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/ooo/trunk/main/dictionaries <None>`_.
This Link will break as soon as the OpenOffice.org-Project comes out
of the apache-incubator.

These are the hyphenation-files that are included in OpenOffice.org.
If you found another hyphenation-file, feel free to contact me or
the OpenOffice.org-Team!

All other locales will simply not be hyphenated but the string to be
hyphenated will be returned "AS IS"
