       The name attribute of the ruleset tag is displayed
       when running PHP_CodeSniffer with the -v command line
       argument.

       If you have custom sniffs, and they use a namespace prefix
       that is different to the name of the directory containing
       your ruleset.xml file, you can set the namespace prefix using
       the namespace attribute of the ruleset tag.

       For example, if your namespace format for sniffs is
       MyProject\CS\Standard\Sniffs\Category, set the namespace to
       MyProject\CS\Standard (everything up to \Sniffs\)

    <!--
       You can hard-code config values used by sniffs directly
       into your custom standard. Note that this does not work
       for config values that override command line arguments,
       such as show_warnings and report_format.

       The following tag is equivalent to the command line argument:
       -runtime-set zend_ca_path /path/to/ZendCodeAnalyzer
    -->
    <!--config name="zend_ca_path" value="/path/to/ZendCodeAnalyzer"/-->

    <!--
        If no files or directories are specified on the command line
        your custom standard can specify what files should be checked
        instead.

        Note that file and directory paths specified in a ruleset are
        relative to the ruleset's location, and that specifying any file or
        directory path on the command line will ignore all file tags.
     -->
    <file>./src</file>
    <file>./tests</file>

    <!--
       You can hard-code ignore patterns directly into your
       custom standard so you don't have to specify the
       patterns on the command line.

       The following two tags are equivalent to the command line argument:
       -ignore=*/tests/*,*/data/*
    -->
    <exclude-pattern>*/share/*</exclude-pattern>
    <exclude-pattern>*/tools/*</exclude-pattern>
    <exclude-pattern>*/bootstrap.php</exclude-pattern>

    <!--
        Patterns can be specified as relative if you would
        like the relative path of the file checked instead of the
        full path. This can sometimes help with portability.

        The relative path is determined based on the paths you
        pass into PHP_CodeSniffer on the command line.
     -->
    <!--exclude-pattern type="relative">^/tests/*</exclude-pattern>
    <exclude-pattern type="relative">^/data/*</exclude-pattern-->

    <!--
       You can hard-code command line values into your custom standard.
       Note that this does not work for the command line values:
       -v[v][v], -l, -d, -sniffs and -standard

       The following tags are equivalent to the command line arguments:
       -report=summary -colors -sp
    -->
    <!--arg name="report" value="summary"/-->
    <arg name="report" value="full"/>
    <arg name="colors"/>
    <arg value="spn"/>

    <!--
       You can hard-code custom php.ini settings into your custom standard.
       The following tag sets the memory limit to 64M.
    -->
    <ini name="memory_limit" value="64M"/>

    <!--
       If your helper classes need custom autoloading rules that you are
       not able to include in other ways, you can hard-code files to include
       before the ruleset is processed and any sniff classes have been loaded.

       This is different to bootstrap files, which are loaded after the ruleset
       has already been processed.
    -->
    <!--autoload>/path/to/autoload.php</autoload>
    <autoload>/path/to/other/autoload.php</autoload-->

    <!--
       Include all sniffs in the PEAR standard. Note that the
       path to the standard does not have to be specified as the
       PEAR standard exists inside the PHP_CodeSniffer install
       directory.
